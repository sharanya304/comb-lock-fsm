##  Project Overview
This project implements a digital **Combination Lock** system using an FSM.  
The lock accepts a **4-digit passcode** as input and grants or denies access accordingly.  

- Implemented in **Verilog HDL**  
- Simulated & Synthesized using **Xilinx Vivado**  
- Includes **FSM state diagram, source code, and testbenches**
